<p>The UbiTok.io exchange platform runs entirely on the blockchain, which means:
<ul>
  <li>no limits, no sign-up, no waiting for support to verify you;</li>
  <li>it cannot be shutdown - not even by its creators;</li>
  <li>you don’t need to trust anyone to look after your coins.</li>
</ul>
We also offer ultra-low fees and a rich trading experience.
</p>

<p>
  UbiTok.io aims to be the leading platform for trading Ethereum assets on-chain,
  and to help grow an ecosystem of smart contracts trading with each other (and with you).

  UbiTok.io full main-net release is coming in October 2017 -
  if you're feeling adventurous you can try out
  <a href="https://ubitok.io/exchange/?pairId=OMG-ETH">our OMG-ETH (OmiseGO) pair</a>
  which is currently in final beta testing.
</p>

  If you don't have an Ethereum account, you could try out our
  <a href="https://ubitok.io/exchange/?pairId=DEMO-ETH">Demo Exchange</a> -
  it's a simulation running in your browser.
  To make it more exciting, there's some simulated trading bots too - can you beat them?

  We also have some Screencasts in <a href="http://ubitok.io/help/depositing-ether-and-buying-tokens-using-metamask/">our tutorial</a>,
  as well as a
  <a href="https://ubitok.io/exchange/?pairId=TESTR-ETH">"play-money" book on the "Ropsten" Ethereum Testnet</a>,
  and also on the (faster) <a href="https://ubitok.io/exchange/?pairId=TESTI-ETH">"Rinkeby" Ethereum Testnet</a>.

<h2 id="what-can-i-trade-on-ubitokio">What can I trade on UbiTok.io?</h2>
<p>Coins/tokens based on Ethereum (such as ERC20 tokens) can be traded on UbiTok.io,
   either against Ethereum or against other tokens. See <a href="products/">our list of products</a>.</p>

<p>Examples of tokens we think are interesting include:
    <a href="https://augur.net/">REP (Augur)</a> (prediction markets),
    <a href="https://0xproject.com/">0x</a> (trading),
    <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">BAT</a> (advertising),
    <a href="https://district0x.io/">district0x</a> (virtual communities),
    <a href="https://omg.omise.co/">OMG</a> (banking), and
    <a href="https://melon.network/">Melon</a> (asset mangement).
</p>

<p>Contact us if you'd like a particular token added.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-ubitokio-compare-to-other-decentralized-exchanges">How does UbiTok.io compare to other decentralized exchanges?</h2>

<p>
  When we looked around, we found that other decentralized exchanges tended to compromise.
  Either they use an off-chain matching engine (meaning they are still vulnerable to downtime and hacking),
  or they stay on-chain but offer a much poorer trading experience than a traditional exchange.
</p>

<p>We were determined to offer a full limit order book with best execution entirely on-chain -
   and thanks to our unique order book representation we succeeded,
   meeting our five goals for our ideal exchange:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no off-chain matching engine so no servers to shut down or be hacked;</li>
  <li>a <a href="trading-rules">full limit order book</a>, giving clients the best possible price and the trading features you expect;</li>
  <li>clients don’t need to install any special P2P software;</li>
  <li>ultra-low fees (none for makers, 0.05% for takers);</li>
  <li>open platform - rather than just being an exchange we want to grow an ecosystem of smart contracts trading with each other.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whos-behind-ubitokio">Who’s behind UbiTok.io?</h2>
<p>In one sense, no-one is - the exchange runs entirely on the Ethereum blockchain, and the open source web UI is statically hosted on github (pending move to Swarm).</p>

<p>
  <img src="img/kieranelby.png" style="float:left;margin:4px;"/>
  UbiTok.io was created by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kieranelby/">Kieran Elby</a>, a technologist with a background in algorithmic trading systems. He previously spent over a decade building secure, high volume gambling sites for leading bookmakers. He first dabbled in bitcoin in 2013 before flipping to Ethereum in 2015.
</p>

<p>The UbiTok.io software copyright and other intellectual property is held by <a href="https://bonnag.com">Bonnag Limited</a>, a UK registered company.</p>

<p>We’re interested in growing our team in future - contact <a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="a5cad5d5cad7d1d0cbccd1ccc0d6e5d0c7ccd1cace8bccca8b">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></p>

<h2 id="are-there-downsides-to-being-100-on-chain">Are there downsides to being 100% on-chain?</h2>
<p>Yes - transaction times are much slower than a centralised exchange. This is hard to avoid - 1000s of Ethereum nodes worldwide need to agree on the state of the orderbook (without trusting each other). You won’t find High Frequency Traders on UbiTok.io - not necessarily a bad thing for everyone else! We’ve also had to reduce the number of price levels offered to allow us to perform best execution on-chain - so you’ll see prices like 1.23, not 1.2298502.</p>

<h2 id="ok-but-how-do-i-withdraw-cash-from-ubitokio">OK, but how do I withdraw cash from UbiTok.io?</h2>
<p>UbiTok.io does not interface with the traditional banking system, so if you need cash in your bank account, you’ll need to use a third-party to turn your Ethereum or Ethereum tokens into cash.</p>

<p>Over time, we’re confident that withdrawing to a bank account will become less necessary for many clients as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>more coins and tokens are built on top of Ethereum, so transactions stay on-chain;</li>
  <li>more merchants accept payments in Ethereum or Ethereum-based tokens;</li>
  <li>more companies offer stable Ethereum tokens backed by fiat currency.</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, we're hoping ERC20 tokens backed by Bitcoin and USD will become popular - UbiTok.io will then be able to offer fiat pairs.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-fees-how-do-ubitokio-make-money">What are your fees? How do UbiTok.io make money?</h2>
<p>Because we’re not dealing with banks, or user sign-ups, or hosting providers, we have much lower costs than traditional exchanges.</p>

<p>We guarantee to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>never charge any fees for depositing or withdrawing Ethereum, or Ethereum-based tokens;</li>
  <li>never charge any trading fees for orders that add liquidity to the exchange (that is, orders that rest on the book);</li>
  <li>never charge a trading fee of more than 0.05% for orders that take liquidity from the exchange (that is, orders that match against an order on the book)</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to avoid relying on trading fees, we hope to offer value-added products and services that build on top of our core exchange - see roadmap below.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have some ideas for smart tokens that can be traded on our exchange, or for autonomous smart contracts that place orders into the exchange - we look forward to seeing what can be done with a fully on-chain trading venue.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-planning-any-sort-of-ico--crowdsale">Are you planning any sort of ICO / crowdsale?</h2>
<p>We are considering using crowdfunding to accelerate our product development (and improve our design and marketing).</p>
<p>We want to be sure we have a working product and a solid business model first.</p>
<p>In preparation for any future crowdfunding, we've created the <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xec2ca0ef7cbbb49d5305f2f85dda24a9c5eda305">"UbiTok.io Reward Token" (UBI)</a> - our exchange contract allows UbiTok.io Reward Tokens to be used instead of ETH to pay fees.</p>
<p>Email fundraising@ubitok.io if you’d like to hear about early opportunities to back us, or if you'd like to get involved with any crowdfunding.</p>

<h2 id="give-me-some-technical-details">Give me some technical details!</h2>
<p>Take a look at our main smart contract here: <a href="https://github.com/bonnag/ubitok-contracts/blob/master/contracts/BookERC20EthV1.sol">BookERC20EthV1.sol</a> (work in progress).</p>
<p>We’re publishing details of how our contracts work on our blog - see our <a href="2017-08-24-maintain-order-book-blockchain-bitmap/">first post</a>.
